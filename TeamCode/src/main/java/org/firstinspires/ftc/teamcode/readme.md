## TeamCode Module

Welcome!

This module, TeamCode, is the place where you will write/paste the code for your team's
robot controller App. This module is currently empty (a clean slate) but the
process for adding OpModes is straightforward.

## Creating your own OpModes

The easiest way to create your own OpMode is to copy a Sample OpMode and make it your own.

Sample opmodes exist in the FtcRobotController module.
To locate these samples, find the FtcRobotController module in the "Project/Android" tab.

Expand the following tree elements:
 FtcRobotController/java/org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller/external/samples

### Naming of Samples

To gain a better understanding of how the samples are organized, and how to interpret the
naming system, it will help to understand the conventions that were used during their creation.

These conventions are described (in detail) in the sample_conventions.md file in this folder.

After the prefix, other conventions will apply:

* Sensor class names are constructed as:    Sensor - Company - Type
* Robot class names are constructed as:     Robot - Mode - Action - OpModetype
* Concept class names are constructed as:   Concept - Topic - OpModetype
* EsDing class names are constructed as:   EsDing - Type

Once you are familiar with the range of samples available, you can choose one to be the
basis for your own robot.  In all cases, the desired sample(s) needs to be copied into
your TeamCode module to be used.
